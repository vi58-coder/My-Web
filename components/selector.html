                        We believe that companies shouldn't have to pay money to be simply be visible on the internet
                        or to provide customers a free estimation service. that's why we dont charge you for writing
                        estimates for free, or for delivering them to customers. We only add a small cacapped
                        platform fee on top of your estimates, which is not either 5% + VAT (i.e 6%)
                        of your total estimate, or $50 + VAT (i.e $60), whatever is less this means even if you creat an
                        estimate for $40,000 we add $60 on top, and the customer would recieve an estimate for $40,060
